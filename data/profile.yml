  Hello! I'm Leo. As you can see from this site, I'm not very good
  at frontend. However, I'm good with data and infrastructure, and
  I like to think I'm dangerous when it comes to backend and platform
  (in a good way, of course!). I also like writing, and making free
  and open source software. Find some interesting pages and posts below!
