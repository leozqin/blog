  alt: people walking toward a dark tunnel with palm trees in the background. monochrome.

  alt: people walking into a tunnel under a red and blue sign that says "Welcome to BLUE GATE - Now Entering DOWNTOWN FAIRPLEX"
  commentary: >
    I really like the composition and exposure of this shot. The light at the end of the tunnel is well-exposed, and the
    the colors are neutral and match my own memory of the shot.

  alt: people walking out of a dark tunnel towards other people in the distance. monochrome.
  commentary: This is great example of letting the dark be dark.

  alt: a food stand that sells ice cream, funnel cakes, and frozen banana. The center of the stand says "Texas Size"
- src: P5240005_processed.jpg
  alt: >
    three corn-shaped signs beside a table with a large mayonnaise pump. The front sign says "entrance", and the rear sign says
    exit/salida. People walk by in the background.

  alt: a large ferris wheel looms over a food stand labeled "michelaguas"
- src: P5240010_processed.jpg
  alt: three people sit on a shaded rocky ledge. One of them in slumped forward. In the distance, a vertical block that says "KID".
- src: P5240011_processed.jpg
  alt: a short stack of pallets in front of several taller stacks. In the distance, an ad for Michelob Ultra on top of a large building.
- src: P5240013_processed.jpg
  alt: people walking down the main street of the fair. Above, a chair lift with numerous chairs moves into the distance.
- src: P5240014_processed.jpg
  alt: four people, one is a wheelchair looking to picture left. Two of them are pointing at something out of frame.
  commentary: I don't do many candids, but this is a portrait crop from a larger landscape image. The simultaneous pointing
    by the people is a happy accident.
- src: P5240017_processed.jpg
  alt: a building with the number 5 on it. Underneath, a sign that says "Welcome to Expo Hall 5"
- src: P5240020_processed.jpg
  alt: a detail of a tree trunk. The bark is cracked and rough. monochrome.
- src: P5240026_processed.jpg
  alt: from below, a quilt mounted to a rail. The light shines through the quilt, which is made of sixty crocheted squares.
- src: P5240029_processed.jpg
  alt: looking up, a geometric pattern comprised of diamonds which supports the roof of the expo hall. soft halos from the lights
    are also visible in the corners. monochrome.
- src: P5240030_processed.jpg
  alt: a large air conditioning unit supported by a platform attached to the wall and hanging from the roof. A sign labeled "10"
    is to the right of the air conditioning unit. monochrome.
- src: P5240031_processed.jpg
  alt: a closet labeled "Fire Alarm - Keep Doors Clear" in a corner of the room. In front of it, a cardboard trashcan. Next to
    the trashcan, a utility panel with caution and warning signs on it. monochrome.
- src: P5240032_processed.jpg
  alt: a display of award-winning art as judged for the fair. In the center a creepy-looking drawing of a demonic nun. To its right
    is a similarly creepy drawing of a clown.
  commentary: Taken through a window (you can see some subtle reflection in the lower left corner), the theme of this display must
    have been "creepy stuff" - there's the nun, the clown, and several other clowns throughout the rest of the display.
- src: P5240035_processed.jpg
  alt: a door to the exterior of the expo hall. The exit sign shines brightly, and the outside is also well exposed. The interior of
    the hall is dark in comparison.
  commentary: I really like this picture - yet another example of letting the dark be dark. But also, the exposure and color rendition
    of the exit sign gives the picture a distinctly urban look.
- src: P5240037_processed.jpg
  alt: a large air conditioning unit attached to a ceiling mounted platform. A sign labled "9" is to the left. monochrome.
- src: P5240040_processed.jpg
  alt: numerous bins of multi-color candy sitting on tables. Surrounding the tables is white picket fencing.
- src: P5240045_processed.jpg
  alt: the beginning of the chairlift ride. On the right, other chairs facing the same direction of travel. On the left, chairs
    making the return trip with their occupants seated. In the middle bottom, a sign that says "one way ride".
- src: P5240050_processed.jpg
  alt: a view of the fair from the chairlift in the air. Below, people walk down the main street of the fair. Numerous chairlift
    cars are visible going in both directions. The sky stretches out above. Monochrome.
  commentary: I like the lines in this photo, but the business of the chairlift wires make it hard to see what's going on
    further down the line. However, I do like that the peaceful sky provides a strong contrast to the bustle of the fair.
- src: P5240052_processed.jpg
  alt: a view of the fair from the chairlift in the air. Below, people walk down the main street of the fair. A support pole
    for the chairlift is prominent on the left. Monochrome.
- src: P5240053_processed.jpg
  alt: four pillars mounted to the side of a building as an architectural interest. They are mostly covered by shadow from the
    overhang, but they also cast their own shadows beneath them. Monochrome.
- src: P5240058_processed.jpg
  alt: ten large horses drawing a carriage down the main street of the fair. Taken from the chairlift above. Other chairs
    can be seen in the distance.
- src: P5240062_processed.jpg
  alt: taken from the chairlift, the chair directly in front is prominent as the list descends to its destination. The San Gabriel
    Mountains are in the background, and many people walk around below. Monochrome.
- src: P5240067_processed.jpg
  alt: Two matched railways for the "Heidi Coaster", taken from below against the sunny sky. Monochrome.
- src: P5240068_processed.jpg
  alt: machinery underneath a carnival ride. Monochrome.
- src: P5240076_processed.jpg
  alt: taken from a ferris wheel, another ferris wheel in the distance framed by the metal gate of the gondola. The clear plastic
    panels in the gate distort the view of the other ferris wheel.
- src: P5240081_processed.jpg
  alt: a colorfully dressed person with a wagon that has a bubble machine attached to it. The person waves wands to create more bubbles.
    Another person holding a child smiles at the bubbles.
- src: P5240082_processed.jpg
  alt: four people walking across a parking lot. above them is an expansive blue sky with some clours. Bubbles can also be seen against
    the sky.
- src: P5240084_processed.jpg
  alt: a red fence containing a petting zoo underneath a tent. Attached to the fence is a sign that says "All creatures barnyard friends"
    and "Back to basics".
- src: P5240086_processed.jpg
  alt: an inflatable pool filled with water. Floating on the water are two large inflatable balls. To the left, a person wearing a red shirt
    helps a child enter another inflatable ball, which is not yet inflated.
- src: P5240090_processed.jpg
  alt: neatly stacked packages of wood shavings atop a pallet. The label on the packages says "Triple Screen Shavings" and "Bed Best".
- src: P5240091_processed.jpg
  alt: three large dumpsters labelled "Athens Services". The first two are open, the one farthest on the left is closed.
- src: P5240095_processed.jpg
  alt: three palm trees stand alone behind a fence in an otherwise empty field. People walk in the foreground.
- src: P5240098_processed.jpg
  alt: numerous handwashing stations next to the petting zoo. In the background are bleachers with people sitting in them.
- src: P5240112_processed.jpg
  alt: four pigs running quickly through a grass path that is fenced off. Children cheer them in the immediate foreground.
- src: P5240123_processed.jpg
  alt: people strapped into a spinning arm at the end of another arm that rotates into the sky.
- src: P5240125_processed.jpg
  alt: numerous people walking around the street of the fair. In the background is a large ferris wheel. monochrome.
- src: P5240126_processed.jpg
  alt: a red fire engine parked in a fire station labelled "FIRE DEPT". An American flag atop a flag pole is at the top of the building.
- src: P5240127_processed.jpg
  alt: a three-quarter profile of a red fire enginer parked in a fire station labelled "FIRE DEPT".
- src: P5240129_processed.jpg
  alt: a three quarter profile of a building. The lighting is harsh and direct, which causes one side of the building to be brightly
    lit and the other to be caught in shadow. Porta-potties are lined up to the left of the building. monochrome.
  commentary: I really the effect of the harsh lighting casting a shadow on the building here. Usually, you have to wait until golden
    hour to get this kind of lighting effect, but this building was in just the right angle to catch the light here.
- src: P5240130_processed.jpg
  alt: a worker in a food stand framed by a window, which is labelled "Fast fresh friendly". The stand itself is labelled
    "fresh lemonade, cheese stick, french fries".
  commentary: A street photography classic! The worker is framed neatly by the window. There is some reflect, but you can see
    them operating the cash register as a long line of people wait for fresh lemonade, cheese sticks, and french fries. Or perhaps
    pickle lemonade, which is just unfathomable to me.
- src: P5240131_processed.jpg
  alt: a parking lot, with the san gabriel mountains in the background set against a blue sky. "Exit ->" has been stenciled
    on one of the barriers.
