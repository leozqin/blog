The photography hobby has taken hold. Some of it is definitely muscle memory from my previous foray into photography. I definitely still remember the exposure triangle and the details of focal length, field of view, and depth of field.

Now that I've been shooting RAW for a while, I've also gotten more experience with photo editing. Rawtherapee is a pretty complex tool, but I think I'm getting the hang of it.

This post is about the difference that photo editing makes. We'll start with two reference pictures - both are of the abandoned car dealership right down the street from me (look, I know this doesn't reflect well on the pleasant ambiance of Covina, but the downtown area is nice!). 

I've edited both of these in my typical style - prioritizing dynamic range and avoiding clipping, with some sharpness adjustment.

Next, the same photo, but in black and white, prioritizing contrast - a "moody" look, if you will. My goal was to produce a darker sky, but without clipping shadows. Again, the RAW files did a good job of keeping detail! A more trained eye may have a different opinion, but I feel that both of these pictures are properly exposed - yet are noticeably different in effect.

Next, I added a thin white border around the photos. The effect, to my eye, of the border is to compress the scene a little bit. The image also feels more composed and elegant, more tempered, in my opinion. What a difference presentation makes!

The same border around the monochromatic images, interestingly, I think feels like it has more contrast.
