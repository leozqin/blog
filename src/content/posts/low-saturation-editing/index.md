One of my longstanding visual preferences for my photos has been to have a pop of color. Perhaps it's because I'm red/green colorblind, but the distinctly digital look of highly saturated images with high contrast has always been quite pleasing to my eye.

In the interest of trying something different, I set out to try and edit some photos with lower levels of saturation and contrast. The result is distinctly film-like; I think I now understand what people mean when they say that film photos have a certain quality to them. Of course, with the somewhat reduced dynamic range and minimal noise the results are still unmistakably digital, but I got a few good ones in the process!

One last thing before we get into the pictures: I [set up a repo](https://github.com/leozqin/photography-workflow) to store my finishing workflow - namely resizing and adding borders! As I come up with more variants, I'll probably add them there. As an aside, if you're interested in the concept of a Dev Container, I highly recommend distrobox to start! I've started shipping Distrobox-compatible images with my projects.

And now the pictures! I took all of these with an Olympus E-PL6 and AstrHori 10mm f/8 lens.

# Urban Decay

One thing I found is that the film-like look really accentuates scenes of urban decay. For better or worse, these can be found in quantity around Covina.

![An alleyway behind several buildings. The reflection of windows is visible on the ground. Powerlines and air conditioning units occupy the space in the background.](./P5190038_processed.jpg)

![A parking lot to an abandoned car dealership filled with new Teslas. The front of the building has a sign that says "USED CARS". The photo was taken over a chainlink fence, part of which is in frame.](./P5190049_processed.jpg)

![A sign that says "CLIPPINGER" against a blue sky. The paint is worn and flaking, and the front panels of the letters have fallen off, revealing the wire structure inside each letter.](./P5190050_processed.jpg)

![The front door to an abandoned car dealership. The numbers "137" are visible above the door. The concrete is cracking and there are conspicuous voids where decorative plants would otherwise be present.](./P5190052_processed.jpg)

![An empty, grassfilled lot behind a chain-link fence. Townhomes are visible in the background. A metal fence pole is directly in the middle of the frame.](./P5190020_processed.jpg)

# Vehicles
As a stylistic choice, I find that red vehicles that would otherwise pop dramatically have a more tempered and liminal feeling when edited with low saturation.

![A red Pontiac Firebird parked next to the sidewalk. The hood has a reverse scoop with a black gradient and black bird on it, as well as undeployed pop-up headlights](./P5190043_processed.jpg)

# Miscellaneous
Overall, I find that photos edited in this style feel more documentary than artistic.

![A rock-covered sign labelled "COVINA PARK". An empty event board is in the immediate background, also labelled "COVINA PARK". Farther in the background are trees and grass.](./P5190031_processed.jpg)

![A pathway between two rows of townhouses. The path is clean and well shaded, with young trees and small palm trees.](./P5190044_processed.jpg)

# Bonus
Thanks for making it to the end! Here's two more saturated picks that I took along the same walk.

First, the old-fashioned State Farm truck, but edited in a more saturated style that is my first instinct, but I notice that there is some clipping and noise in the sky due to the high contrast.

In the background is a used car dealership. The colors are bright and saturated. The sky is somewhat clipped.](./P5190017_processed.jpg)

Then, a view down the stairs to the first floor of my house, in the dark. I really like the exposure of this shot; sometimes the dark can just be dark!
