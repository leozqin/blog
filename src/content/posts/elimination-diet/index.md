For the past 46 days, I've been doing an elimination diet to see if it would help with my seemingly year-round nasal allergies. In this time, I've been through testing rounds for wheat, corn, soy, dairy, tomatoes, citrus, beef, pork, shellfish, eggs, and tree nuts, plus two completely allergen free weeks to try and start from a clean slate.

Today is the final day. As it turns out, I'm sensitive to wheat and dairy, and maybe slightly to beef.

Now that the end is in sight, I feel drawn to write about the experience, because it's been quite an instructive one.

# Misinformation is rife
Ok, so I feel like the above could be said about the current information environment in general, but I definitely bumped up against that while planning and executing on this. 

I think my overall recommendation is to either do it in close collaboration with a doctor or nutritionist, or with clear and well-documented instructions from one. In my case, perhaps because my symptoms weren't too severe, I felt like my doctor just made an off-hand suggestion to try it, which I latched onto. In fact, when she brought it up, she recommended watching YouTube videos or finding a book.

Basically, having been left on my own to figure out how to do this, I got to Googling. First off, I found that there's a huge overlap between the pseudo-science "wellness" crowd and almost any kind of niche or unusual diet. Lots of recommendations to avoid seed oils, MSG, or white sugar, or explanations about how reactions to food can be due to "whole body" inflammation disorders. I'm sure you've got a supplement to sell me.

I eventually ended up going with the [University of Wisconsin Madison Family Medicine instructions](https://www.fammed.wisc.edu/files/webfm-uploads/documents/outreach/im/handout_elimination_diet_patient.pdf)(UWFM) for doing an elimination diet. It was by far the most clearly written, obviously scientific, and experimentally sound approach. 

Understanding the UWFM guidelines, it became pretty obvious that your typical wellness blog has no idea what it's talking about. For example - the guidance to avoid seed oils invariably comes with a recommendation to use butter instead. But, obviously butter squarely falls into the category of dairy. Similarly, recommendations to avoid processed or white sugar are simply incompatible with the UWFM guidelines - which call for avoiding artificial sweeteners in lieu of cane or beet sugar.

The clear and obvious solution is to do this in collaboration with people who actually do know what they're talking about - and I'm not talking about wellness bloggers. Ideally, I'd have liked to do this with a registered dietician or a doctor who was a little more attentive, but I've got an HMO insurance, and I guess "google it" was good enough.

# It's way easier if you know how to cook
Fairly early on, I came to the realization that many common allergens are extremely hard to avoid if you don't know how to cook. For example, soy is kind of everywhere - anything that uses soy sauce or soy protein. Similarly, eggs are used as a texture enhancer in all kinds of things.

So, the most straightforward way to consistently avoid allergens is to cook for yourself. Note that I said straightforward, not easy. Throughout this experience, I regularly spent 45 minutes to an hour cooking each day. Luckily, I work from home, live alone, and also happen to both enjoy and have experience in cooking. I could see that having to balance cooking with taking care of children, or also cooking for others that aren't doing the elimination diet and are perhaps picky eaters could be extremely difficult.

The other reason why cooking makes things easier is that allergens can find their way unwittingly into food that others make for you, either through contamination or from seasoning/technique that you don't think about. A great example is breading - sometimes, in order to make french fries (nominally potatoes, which are allowed), restaurants will lightly batter them before frying for a crisper result. If you have to strictly avoid wheat, this could be a disruption.

During the initial elimination phase, I avoided restaurants altogether, which I found quite difficult. During later phases, and especially after I began to actually find and understand sensitivities, I allowed myself to make some compromises. I've never been the kind to extensively modify restaurant orders - I find it somewhat embarassing, but again - I know how to cook for myself.

# Moving resolutely is crucial
Mentally/psychologically, the initial elimination phase was the hardest for me. For one, it was two whole weeks of strict avoidance, and at that point I was so used to being congested and sniffly that I couldn't consistently tell when I wasn't feeling that way. I also took somewhat of a narrow view of what I could eat (which we'll touch on later), and was getting bored.

The latter phases were easier - I've always had a scientific interest in experimentation, and fitting in foods with allergens during testing phases was an interesting exercise in critical thinking. Many of the people around me, however, really sympathized with me - they felt like they could not do an elimination without some temptation to cheat, or that it would just simply be better to live with symptoms but without restrictions.

On the latter, I don't find that reasoning to be particularly compelling. For one, I've been living with symptoms for years, so I don't really know what it feels like to live without symptoms; it could be awesome! But also, intuitively I understand that most people don't go around having seasonal allergy symptoms year-round, and I know that I don't enjoy experiencing symptoms. So - I'm intrigued by the weather on the other side of the fence, in a manner of speaking.

One thing that really helped me to understand the scale of my symptoms was data collection. I started an allergy diary in a google doc, and set an alarm three times per day to remind me to write down how I'm feeling. This definitely helped me to understand better what it means to be "mostly clear" or "a little sniffly".

A pretty common question I had was whether I could add back in foods that had been determined to be safe. According to the UWFM instructions, the answer is no, but they don't really give a reason. I suspect that it's to keep the experiment design simple, and help to avoid situations where hidden allergens sneak in. However, being a precaution and not a principle, it's not wrong that if something doesn't cause a reaction, you shouldn't necessarily have to stop it altogether.

I've come to realize that, for me, following doctors instructions (in this case, UWFM) is political. I believe in trusting and respecting expertise, and so resisting the temptation to go my own way is part of living out that principle.

# Create a broader understanding of your safe foods and try new things
The first week of the elimination phase, as I was trying to get my bearings, I basically had roasted vegetables, potatoes, and chicken thighs every day. It was very boring, and it really diminished the joy of food for me. I remember vividly trying something new and making sweet potatoes instead, realizing that I don't really like sweet potatoes, and I couldn't bring myself to finish that plate - something which almost never happens to me. So yeah, it was grim.

It was also a failure of imagination, because you can actually fit quite a bit of variety into an elimination diet if you think creatively. One of the happiest days of the diet was when my partner pointed out to me that very simple (either nigiri sushi, or simple maki - rice + fish + nori only) sushi fit neatly into the profile, as long as I didn't use soy sauce.

On the topic of soy sauce, my enjoyment of sushi was also improved when I remembered about coconut aminos. It's not quite the same thing as soy sauce, but I think that it scratches the same itch.

Another pragmatic food combination that remains safe is "wings and fries". Admittedly, to do this you have to be confident that a little wheat contamination from breading won't trigger symptoms and avoid most sauces, but if you can deal with that - wings and fries are available from pretty much everywhere.

# Science on the human timescale is so hard
It was not entirely surprising or unexpected to me that I found the scientific/experimentation part of the elimination diet enjoyable. However, in the same spirit I also fund myself having moments of doubt about the efficacy of the experiment.

For example, at the same time that my doctor suggested doing this, we also started trying a different daily allergy medication (all others having not worked before). It is entirely possible that improvements in my symptoms can be explained by a change in medication.

Similarly, I can't eliminate the possibility that simple improvements in the quality of my diet have helped my symptoms, or that I haven't actually experienced any improvement in symptoms, broken as my sense of equilibrium has been. To the latter, at least, others that I've been around have confidently said that I seem to be doing better.

At the end of the day, it is the case that doing science on a human timescale simply is difficult. However, the purpose of doing this particular science has always been not to learn the answers, but rather to reap the benefits. Doubts about experimental design aside, I can empirically state that I feel better, and that's good enough!
