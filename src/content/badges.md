One of my favorite parts of web 1.0 was the website badge. Nowadays, the whole concept has kind of been subsumed by eCommerce trust seals (bordering on SEO garbage, imo), but back in the day they were THE way to show off your affinities, and also a helpful way to produce a dense web of links. That is, after all, what the web used to be (an interconnected series of links).

As it turns out, I've got the pipeline of building a website badge down to about a 60 second operation. So - the purpose of this page is to share all the badges that I create. You can also go to [my github](https://github.com/leozqin/blog/tree/main/src/components/badges) to download the source code these pure CSS + HTML + SVG badges.

They're built as Astro components, and you'll also need the AstroJS/Icon integration.
