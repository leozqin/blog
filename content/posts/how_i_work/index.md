The purpose of this post is to explain how I like to Do Work and the principles underlying those decisions. This not meant to say that I consider the way I work to be the only correct one, nor that I am unwilling to try other ways of working. However - the impression that I would like readers to come away with is that the way I work is principled, considered, and intentional. If you're a recruiter looking for something akin to a cover letter, this is about as close as it gets. I think a lot about why I do things the way that I do, and this post explains the internal logic of how I work.
