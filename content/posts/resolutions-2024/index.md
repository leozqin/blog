The theory of this post is this - what can I do over the next year to make myself and my loved ones more free? By free, I mean free as in freedom, not free as in beer.

I think this is different from resolutions in that it's more about broad philosophical strokes rather than discrete actions. But also, I want to try and avoid the idealistic, unachievable, and self-flagellating-in-failure nature of your typical set of New Year's resolutions.

Maybe this can take the form of a retrospective (stop/start/keep doing)? Or, perhaps am I just writing OKRs? Oh god... let's get this thing started!

The broadest stroke of the tech in the 2010s was intermediation. By this, I mean the change in the nature of business as being mediated by middle-men to one being marketed to and bought directly by consumers (what a horrid thing to refer to people as). Some examples?

- Airbnb disintermediated the hotel industry by letting consumers and homeowners make bookings directly with each other.
- Uber and Lyft disintermediated the taxi industry by letting consumers and car owners make their own travel arrangements.
- Digital insurance brokers disintermediated individual insurance agencies by letting consumers buy policies directly from insurance companies.

The capitalist would say that these are good things - there was inefficiency in these industries, and technology helped them to become more efficient. Who among us hasn't had a weird or dodgy experience in a taxi, hotel, or buying insurance? Perhaps a little competition would drive everyone to be a little better.

And yet, the result of disintermediation could be more accurately described as theft. Maybe you're reacting harshly to that word, thinking, well, if Uber hadn't created a vast underclass of independent contractors making poverty wages, taxi drivers would still be mean to me. 

This analysis fails, however, when you consider that nothing about distintermediation requires any particular technology. Yes, I know that AirBnB, Uber, et al produced all kinds of technology (much of it open source), but none of it was crucial for the act of disintermediation. It's hard to disprove a counterfactual that taxis might have ended up installing credit card readers simply because the cost of credit card readers came down due to better technology. 

Furthermore, perhaps, in the absence of "competitive forces", we simply created regulations that govern the behavior and business practices of taxi drivers? Yeah - such things already exist, and we didn't need to create said underclass just to have them.

The point is this - even if you believe that competition drives people to make better products, the undeniable outcome of distintermediation shows that we've come too far, and now the pendulum is beginning to swing back the other way. 

"Enshittification" has come for the distintermediators, again demonstrating that they didn't bring any actual innovation or efficiency to the table, they just bought money to burn; money which they used to buy a monopoly, and we're now entering the exploitation phase of monopoly. When VCs talk about "moats", they're talking about the means and methods to survive long enough to achieve monopoly.

I think that this process really highlights my skepticism of consumer startups. The first thing is, if you define your market as all consumers (again, ick), then the potential impact of the choices you make are much higher. Because the thing you're building is for *regular people*, you will inevitably affect *regular people*. This should not be taken lightly - only those that have confidence, or better yet, a structural guarantee that their business model will do no harm should play in this space.

Interestingly, I think that this does merit a lower bar for B2B startups; while they can be somewhat banal, there is less risk and motive to harm, and that is preferable. At the end of day, *corporations are not people*, no matter how much the US Supreme Court wants them to be. I do want to keep some space for the risk of labor disintermediation, though - to the degree that "AI" startups in particular seek to "replace workers", I think that they will be ultimately unsuccessful simply because the quality is not there, and never will be.

Finally - as I write this I find a common theme when I consider the most harmful disintermediators - they are marketplaces. 

Anyway, the underlying theme of my personal resolutions in 2025 will be to disintermediate the disintermediators - many of the services that they provide are things that I can build or maintain on my own - and for everything else, hotels, taxis, and insurance agencies still exist, you know? What if we just... used them?

I get it, I'm kind of crazy. It's certainly true that my life will be a little less convenient and more expensive, but as I said, these are choices made in service of freedom, not convenience or economy.

Here's the broad strokes of what I intend to do:

- Quit by way of orbital cannon:
    - TikTok (I actually did this cold-turkey in November; I don't miss it at all)
    - Uber
    - AirBnB
    - Reddit
    - Hulu (probably)
    - Amazon Prime
    - Chrome for Work (I already use Firefox for everything personal)
    - Doordash
- Quit by way of neglect
    - LinkedIn (bleh)
    - Lyft (as a backup, but might go orbital cannon on this one if I can find a good alternative)
    - Expedia (already, I rarely use this)
- Replace
    - Google Search (with SearXNG or DDG, probably)
    - GoDaddy (with Cloudflare)
    - OpenAI (with locally run LLMs - for Precis)
- Stretch
    - Amazon.com (I've already shifted most purchases to eBay, but need to find an alternative for medications)
    - Google Drive/Google Photos (low impact - I just don't use these services that much)
- Not this year, but eventually
    - Gmail (unfortunately, due to OAuth will probably have to be a "neglect", but may shift primary communications to an email domain that I control)
- Needs more research
    - YouTube (I've already shifted my music to Tidal, but does YT pay creators fairly for Premium?)
