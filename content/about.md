# Frameworks
This blog is the second iteration of my blog. The first one was a WordPress site hosted on GoDaddy using a version of PHP that was many versions too old, a super heavy theme, and an extremely complex block based layout generator.

This second iteration is a completely static site generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

I've created a custom theme for this blog, which you can find [here](https://github.com/leozqin/blog/tree/main/themes). Except for a small bundle for [Cloudflare Web Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/web-analytics/), this site uses no client-side scripting.

# Architecture
This blog is served by [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/), using [their built-in Hugo integration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-hugo-site/). In particular, I use their integration with GitHub, where they subscribe to the `main` branch of a dedicated blog repository. So, when I push to `main`, Cloudflare will react by pulling down my changes and re-building and re-deploying the site. In practice, this takes less than a minute, sometimes less than 30 seconds.
